#Database-project
This project was the final project in university database course, and it was made with the collaboration
with two other students. In our database we are keeping a record of imaginary universityÂ´s functioning
like courses, exams and students. SQL file "Creating database" contains the code for creating the database
and adding imaginary data in it. Other file named "Commands to the database" contains different commands
to test how the database works. In addition, there is UML-diagram to illustrate the relations between
different classes.
